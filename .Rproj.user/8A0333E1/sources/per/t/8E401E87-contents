# Introduction

This is a (hopefully) continuously increasing collection of `R` tutorials and code collections relevant for Forest Ecosystem Sciences, curated by three R enthusiasts at the School of Ecosystem and Forest Sciences - Uni Melbourne. 

Nevertheless, most tutorials can be useful for anyone starting out in `R` or looking to broaden their skills and learn something new, that we had to learn ourselves.

We currently cover:

- Setting up *RStudio*, working with projects and using code folds
- A brief description on data and variables types
- Introductions to using the `tidyverse` packages `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, for easy data manipulation and visualization
- An Introduction to using spatial data in R with both the `sf` and `raster` packages.
- Introduction to basic linear and generalized linear modeling in `R`
- A tutorial on functions and loops in `R` and the use of `lapply` and `mapply`
- A tutorial on using the package `lidR` to process pointclouds from LiDAR data and photogrammetry
- Code chunks for area calculations of rasters and fractions in classified rasters
- more is coming ... watch this space!

# An Intro to R for Forest Ecosystem Science Bookdown project

This is a (hopefully) continuously increasing collection of R tutorials and code collections relevant for Forest Ecosystem Sciences, curated by three R enthusiasts at the School of Ecosystem and Forest Sciences - Uni Melbourne.

Nevertheless, most tutorials can be useful for anyone starting out in R or looking to broaden their skills and learn something new, that we had to learn ourselves.

## Note:

.RMD files go into the main repository. Any data used for the sepearte .rmds goes into the data folder. To publish/update the book, keep the _bookdown.yml as it is.
